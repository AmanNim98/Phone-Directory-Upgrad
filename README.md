This is a Phone-directory Application, a solution to the assignment provided by Upgrad for there "Summer Internship".
I have used Javascript, HTML, CSS to make this application. 
I have used validations in the fields to ensure the authenticity of the information stored. 
The data gets stored in real time and can be seen in the application itself.
You can also delete the data from the application itself.
